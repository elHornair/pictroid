## Setup
- Check out the git repo
- Open 'index.html' in your browser
- Have fun

## Usage
- Your goal is to let the pictroid reach the green area
- Drag the commands in the upper left corner and drop them into the 'code area' beneath
- You can reorder and remove commands that are already in the 'code area' (again with drag'n'drop)
- Let the pictroid run the code by clicking on "run code"
- You can adapt the commands and let the pictroid rerun the code - but first you need to reset him
